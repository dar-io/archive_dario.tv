From all of them the prototype was the one preferred by the majority of the participants of this experiment.
The current website was the last of the choices, even when compared with the MVP

  In terms of structure, all Respondents Reacted positively to both MVP and Prototype. However, the Prototype presented a greater structure in the eyes of the participants. In general the prototype seem to be more clear and easy to operate.

The prototype makes best use of images, helping to give structure to the page and to better connect and illustrate the News stories.

We noticed that the respondents tended to skim read the content of the page. Mainly the used categories, images and headlines to choose which stories to read. Also, the majority used only Images to identify the story, rather then by reading the Headlines.

In Mexico, the Headlines perceived too small. Nevertheless, Category, Image and Headline were more important then the copy detail.

<figure class="large-img">

The timestamps were seen as a positive element. It helped to add freshness the news. Also, established a timeline of events

Topic headings, helped categorize stories. But not always was seen as useful. Either either in Mexico or India.

Smaller font sizes and the bigger images helped to reduce the white space between top stories items, offering a more visual coherence.

In Mexico all respondents located “Sport” without difficulties (Hidden in the more section). In India the order of the nav items wasn’t appropriate. Serious content should come first.

The categories within the MVP were clear but the ordering did not necessarily appeal within the prototype.

Live Radio – Respondents thought the live radio badge would open a live radio transmission

<strong>Rolling news</strong> – Was only available on the BBC Mundo Prototype.

</figure>
7 out of 10 the majority of Mexican users preferred “Rolling News” on the right hand side of the page. Offered higher visibility and easy access. It offered constantly up-to-date news easy to skim read.

Another interesting result came from the experience of use the video Carousel.

When first tested in Mexico city, the majority of the participants demonstrated difficulties in find the ‘Back and forward’ bottoms during the experiment. Because this was potentially obstructing the user’s experience, the ‘Back and forward’ controllers were modified for the Delhi experiment.

By exposing the controllers, initially hidden, allowed users to explore all the potentialities of this section.

And the same happened with the pictures carousel!

Users in Mexico thought that Most Popular module was too far down the page and therefore too easy to miss.

The organization of the news by the ranking of its popularity was also denoted as positive element.

The integration of social network connections gave a sense of modernity and innovation to the site, allowing a easier and more interactive access to the News

 All Consumed news stories in a similar fashion, high engagement in the initial headline, image and summary text. Skim reading often starts after the 3rd paragraph and it stops at the bottom of the article.

 Images, quotes and subheadings helped to break up content and ease skim reading.

 Stories tested were seen as being too lengthy and excessive detailed. Majority of the respondents wanted detailed stories but kept to the point and brief as possible.

In Mexico, related stories was too low in the page. Text based look & feel lack impact, most of the participants wanted to see imagery.

Few respondents would engage with it. Often related stories are old news. They want to consume news that are happening now.

In Dehli, most users did not engaged with related stories. Few or any, didn't get to the end of the story. The large image was thought to be an advert or a footer of the page and therefore avoided. Also, the copy failed to promote further exploration

Sharing content was important to the majority. The pop-up panel was more appealing than the current MVP share buttons

In India sharing was recognized by the icon. The sharing label wasn't understood by many.

The number of shares was also understood by the majority however, it is important to highlight that a small number of shares does not have any affect on their likelihood to read a story or share.
