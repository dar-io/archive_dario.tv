In 2016, I was tasked to improve the user experience of the BBC News front page so that it caters for under-served audiences, drives onward journeys, and enables editorial to curate the news agenda with a design that provides flexibility and reflects timeliness.

<h3>Why redesign the News front page?</h3>
The BBC News site is used and loved by millions of loyal users. The front page receives well over of 100 million page views from about 18 million browsers each week. It is the most popular page across BBC digital products. However, despite such success, the page presented a few problems:

<ul>
  <li>Struggled to engage and attract 16-34-year-olds, mainly young females and minority ethnic audiences</li>
  <li>Lacked flexibility for editorial to curate and present news content focused on a particular theme or topic.</li>
  <li>The real-estate on larger screens wasn't being used effectively. </li>
  <li>Relied on ageing in-house servers.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Target Audience</h3>

  <figcaption>Key traits of BBC News personas: Headlines only, Social Mobile Tweeters, Local Feelgood, Social Connectors and Supervisual Snackers</figcaption>
</figure>

The BBC News attracts audiences with vastly differing characteristics. I have designed the front page accordingly to five types of personas. These are:  

<ol>
  <li><strong>Headlines only</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Social Mobile Tweeters</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Local Feelgood</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Social Connectors</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Supervisual Snackers</strong></li>
</ol>

The challenge was to attract 16-34-year-olds, young females and minority ethnic users, while keeping our core user base aged over 35s happy.

Establishing the right balance between hard and soft news was essential to attract a broader audience to the BBC News site.

<h2>My Role</h2>
<i>My role, above all was to empathize with the BBC News audiences while delivering the business goals.</i>

<strong>Audience Insights and Ideation</strong><br />
I led the discovery phase. This involved doing competitor research, gathering audience insights and shadowing front page editors to understand the editorial workflow.

During the discovery phase, I sketched on paper to get ideas flowing and iterated on them before opening a design tool.

<strong>Product Team</strong><br />
I partnered with the product owner and project manager for the BBC News responsive site to prioritise and negotiate features for launch. I evangelised audience and business goals.

<strong>Editorial Team & Senior Stakeholders</strong><br />
To help define the content strategy for the BBC News front page and to manage expectations, I ran workshops with Editorial and Senior Stakeholders. I've also presented works to share the vision and gain buy‚Äêin.

I collaborated with stakeholders from Global News Limited (the commercial arm of BBC News), to ensure that the front page supports commercial content for international audiences.

<strong>Design Execution</strong><br />
I designed in the browser and created responsive prototypes in HTML/CSS/Javascript to share the vision, design principles and content strategy. This helped to galvanise the team around a common goal and drive the decision making.

<strong>Engineering Team</strong><br />
By designing in the browser I established a closer relationship with the Engineering Team. There was no need to create design specs. I was using the same frontend tools they use. I also worked with them to make the front page accessible.

<strong>Cross product coordination</strong><br />
I collaborated with the BBC Global Experience Language (GEL) design team to redefine the grid for wider screens, and to ensure consistency across our platform by using reusable components and improving existing design patterns.

I cooperated with the BBC News World Service design team to ensure that the News front page design supports multiple languages.

<strong>Usability Research</strong><br />
I worked with the research team to help define research goals. I went to usability research sessions in London and Toronto with the research team to gather feedback and validate design concepts.

<h2>Design Process</h2>
Observe. Think. Make. Test. Repeat. These are the core steps of my design process.

  <figcaption>Early sketch of the News front page focused on targeting underserved audiences and exploring the question: How Might We effectively showcase Features, Live, Video and Visual Journalism to surface the depth and breadth of content from across BBC News output?</figcaption>
</figure>

<h4>Talk to people. Observe. Get inspired.</h4>
<i>Talk to people, analyse data, gather requirements, observe, throw away any preconceived assumptions. Inspire new thinking by observing problems from different angles.</i>

During the discovery phase, I started gathering requirements from stakeholders and also learning who are the decision makers. For an organisation the size of the BBC, the decision-making process can be complex.

  <figcaption>Previous BBC News front page showing the most popular sections users click on mobile, tablet and desktop. Data shows that top stories performs better that any other section. Sections below the fold, don't perform very well.</figcaption>
</figure>

I carried out audience and competitor analysis to gather data and insights into user behaviours. These are some of the metrics that inform my design decisions.

I shadowed senior front page editors and journalists to understand their workflow when curating stories to be featured on the front page.

I talked to engineers. I questioned everything and challenged any preconceived assumption.

<h4>Make sense of the findings</h4>
At this stage, I synthesise the unstructured data and started grouping the findings into themes. Themes are then converted into HMW questions (‚ÄúHow Might We...‚Äù):

<ul>
  <li>How Might We achieve optimal content density?</li>
  <li>How Might We create better content groupings </li>
  <li>How Might We entice people to scroll further down the page</li>
  <li>How Might We create a design that caters for underserved audiences?</li>
  <li>How Might We offer flexibility for Editorial to curate the news depending on the news agenda?</li>
</ul>


<h4>Don't get attached to ideas</h4>
<figure class="section__title large-img">
  <img src="/assets/images/homepage/wall-with-sketches.jpg" alt=""/>
    <figcaption>During our weekly design critique team meetings, we've encouraged designers to explore ideas on how they would see the BBC News front page evolve</figcaption>
</figure>


I start sketching on paper and presenting ideas during the design critique team meetings. I don't get attached to any idea. This is a collective process of throwing away ideas. By eliminating ideas only the good ones persist or at least the ones that are technically feasible.

</figure>

One of the outcomes was the introduction of "Slices". Slices run horizontally across the full width of the screen. They are easy to reorder, the content hierarchy is consistent across all the breakpoints. It also provides more flexibility for editorial to reorder content depending on the news agenda.

This approach required defining new content groupings. The next step was to organise an editorial and product workshop.

<h4>Editorial and product workshop</h4>

  <img src="/assets/images/homepage/editorial-workshop.jpg" alt=""/>
  <figcaption>Pruning, Grouping and Ordering content workshop with Editorial and Product stakeholders to define the content strategy for the BBC News front page </figcaption>
</figure>>

The goal of the Editorial and Product workshop was to prune, group, reorder content, and to move away from the traditional sectioned content.

Three groups of mixed people representing product and editorial were created. I moderated a group of very challenging stakeholders.

The outcome was positive. The information for each section on the front page was organised into themes. It was time to use this information in the designs and prototypes.

<h3>Designing in the Browser</h3>
The design process started in the paper, then I moved into Sketch App to design high fidelity mockups. This proved to be challenging to solve problems when reflowing content across breakpoints. I wanted to come up with a solid solution that engineers could use to build the BBC News front page.  

To solve problems before they appear before the build, I designed most of the BBC News front page in HTML/CSS/JS. This was done to facilitate the communication with the engineering team, stakeholders and to drive the decision-making process.

In my experience designing a responsive site as static designs in Sketch, Illustrator or Photoshop makes it harder to have a discussion with software engineers and to get the buy-in from stakeholders.   

Designing in HTML/CSS was a way to solve frontend problems before they happen during the build.

I worked closely with software engineers to solve design challenges and improve accessibility

<strong>User Testing</strong><br />
 Designing in the browser empowered me to frequently carry-out guerrilla testing sessions. We also tested the prototypes in the UK and in Canada.

<h2>Outcome</h2>
<figure class="section__title large-img">
  <img src="/assets/images/homepage/data-article-views-from-frontpage.jpg" alt="Early front page sketch"/>
</figure>

The front page is now better at getting people to content: bounce rate (the proportion of visits that result in a user leaving the BBC News site without visiting any other News page) is down 2% and overall 26% of all article views in News are now driven by the front page, up from 22% on the old page.

The page also does a much better job of getting people to video content, with 32% of video page views coming from the front page versus 10% previously. It is also making people come back more often: front page users now come back on average 9% more often during a week than they did with the old page design.
