    Description:
      - Paragraph: "Videos of the Day (VotD) formerly known has Ten to Watch, was created to be a finite package of succinct, sharply edited and visually-enticing videos, made to be viewed vertically in full screen, and designed to encourage habitual usage."

    H2-Heading: The Problem
    Description:
      - Paragraph: "Videos of the Day was conceptualised and executed to be a package of ten videos accessed through a single access point — the Videos of the Day promo. Taping on the VotD promo, takes the user to video 1. This created problems such as:"

      - Paragraph: "Users are not exploring the full package of videos. The deeper the videos are from the start of the carousel, the bigger is the drop in video views."  

      - Paragraph: "We know that users who have visited VotD come back more frequently and view significantly more video. But, there has been some potential negative effects on the News app video viewing which has seen a (-24%) decline in daily video views."

      - Heading:
      - Paragraph: "Improve the click-through rate into the Videos of the Day and BBC Stories experiences. By including more detail from within the package on the promo (currently just images, but potentially including headlines and summaries) may increase engagement."

      - Paragraph: "Changing the existing model (a single entry point into a linear experience) may compromise the editorial integrity of the package concept."

    H2-Heading: The Approach
    Subheading:
    Description:
      - H3-Heading: The Three Amigos — Kick off session with UX, BA and Developers
      - Paragraph: |
           At the outset of the project, we agreed that it was important for myself (UX), a Business Analyst, a iOS and Android Developer to collaborate in building a shared understanding, on how we could deliver improvements to Videos of the Day and the BBC Stories promo.
      - Paragraph: |
          To improve the click-through rate into the Videos of the Day and BBC Stories experiences, we devised three hypothesis:
    O-List:
      - Bullet: <strong><i>If</i></strong> we display the number of videos in the package next to a <i>watch</i> CTA,  <strong><i>then</i></strong> more users will tap on the promo, scroll further down the package and watch more videos, <strong><i>because</i></strong> they will know how many videos are in the package.

      - Bullet: <strong><i>If</i></strong> we display the videos' headline and image rotating within the promo, <strong><i>then</i></strong> it will be more likely for users to tap on it, <strong> <i>because</i> </strong> the image and the headline will grab user's attention to explore the VotD package.

      - Bullet: <strong><i>If</i></strong> users have the option to preview the package of videos by using a carousel instead of a single promo, <strong><i>then</i></strong> users can pick the video that most interests them from the carousel. This could result in an increase of video views, <strong> <i>because</i> </strong> we will be providing multiple access points in to VotD in a non-linear fashion.

      - H3-Heading: Guerrilla Testing Outcome
      - Paragraph: "Guerrilla testing helped us validate hypothesis number three. Changing the promo to a carousel, performed better among the people we tested on the street. Users prefer to have the option to preview the stories available in the package before committing to watch a video."
