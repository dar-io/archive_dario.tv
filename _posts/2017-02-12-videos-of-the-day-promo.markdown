    Description:
      - Paragraph: "Videos of the Day (VotD) was created to be a finite package of succinct, sharply edited and visually-enticing videos, made to be viewed vertically in full screen, and designed to encourage habitual usage. The package of vertical video is accessed by a single entry point from the News app Top Stories. I was the design lead tasked to improve the promo engagement and increase video plays."

    H2-Heading: The Problem
    Description:
      - Paragraph: "VotD was conceptualised and executed to be a package of ten videos accessed through a single access point â€” the Videos of the Day promo. Taping on the VotD promo, takes the user to video 1. This created problems such as:"

      - Paragraph: "Users are not exploring the full package of videos. The deeper the videos are from the start of the carousel, the bigger is the drop in video views."  

      - Paragraph: "Users who have visited VotD come back more frequently and view significantly more video. But, there have been some potential negative effects on the News app video viewing which has seen a (-24%) decline in daily video views."

    H2-Heading: The Challenge
    Description:
      - Heading:
      - Paragraph: "Improve the click-through rate into the Videos of the Day and BBC Stories experiences. By including more detail from within the package on the promo (currently just images, but potentially including headlines and summaries) may increase engagement."

      - Paragraph: "Changing the existing model (a single entry point into a linear experience) may compromise the editorial integrity of the package concept."

    Description:

      - Paragraph: "I was the design lead working with a Business Analyst, an iOS and an Android developer"

      - Paragraph: "I created the visual and interaction designs. Built several prototypes and used them to conduct guerrilla testing and presented the findings to the product team."

      - H3-Heading: Three Amigos Workshop
      - Paragraph: |
          <strong>Kick off session with UX, BA and Developers</strong> <br /> At the outset of the project, we agreed that it was important for myself (UX), a Business Analyst, a iOS and Android Developer to collaborate in building a shared understanding, on how we could deliver improvements to Videos of the Day and the Stories promo.

    H2-Heading: Outcome
    Description:
      - Paragraph: "The front page is now better at getting people to content: bounce rate (the proportion of visits that result in a user leaving the BBC News site without visiting any other News page) is down 2% and overall 26% of all article views in News are now driven by the front page, up from 22% on the old page."

      - Paragraph: "The page also does a much better job of getting people to video content, with 32% of video page views coming from the front page versus 10% previously. It is also making people come back more often: front page users now come back on average 9% more often during a week than they did with the old page design."

      - H3-Heading: What I learned?
      - Paragraph: "Using the same materials and language of the Web to created designs that look and feel like the real thing, helped to influence the outcome of the project. It made it easy to get the buy-in of most people, and easier to share the work with stakeholders."

      - Paragraph: "The engineers were incredibly busy moving the front page to the Cloud to ensure scalability and to reduce our reliance on ageing in-house server. This is where designing in the browser also helped reduce some of the overhead when a designer creates unbuildable designs. Engineers, could just use the browser inspector tools look into my prototype to help solve some of their frontend problems."

      - Heading: Cons
      - Paragraph: "Designing in browser requires time to prepare the structure of what you want to achieve. But once it's all set up, designing components in HTML/CSS, can be as fast as designing in a design tool."

      - Paragraph: "Be prepared for a designer to ask you for the latest Sketch designs of what you are doing. Most of the time I forward the the URL for the prototype, other times at the end of the day, I had to translate what I did in browser to Sketch. It's best to let your team know upfront that your designs will only be available in HTML/CSS to avoid disappointment."
