In 2016, I was tasked to improve the user experience of the BBC News homepage so that it caters for under-served audiences, drives onward journeys, and enables editorial to curate the news agenda with a design that provides flexibility and reflects timeliness.

<h3>Why redesign the News homepage?</h3>
The BBC News site is used and loved by millions of loyal users. The homepage receives well over of 100 million page views from about 18 million browsers each week. It is the most popular page across BBC digital products. However, despite such success the page presented a few problems:

<ul>
  <li>Struggled to engage and attract 16-34-year-olds, mainly young females and minority ethnic audiences</li>
  <li>Lacked flexibility for editorial to curate and present news content focused on a particular theme or topic.</li>
  <li>The real-estate on larger screens wasn't being used effectively. </li>
  <li>Relied on ageing in-house servers.</li>
</ul>



<h3>Target Audience</h3>
The BBC News attracts audiences with vastly differing characteristics. I have designed the homepage accordingly to five types of personas. These are:  

<ol>
  <li><strong>Headlines only –</strong> <i>“I am only interested in the headlines – I like my news short and sweet”</i></li>
  <li><strong>Supervisual Snackers –</strong> <i>“I Know its a cliché, but a picture paints a thousand words”</i></li>
  <li><strong>Social Mobile Tweeters –</strong> <i>“I like the news to be easy to digest”</i></li>
  <li><strong>Local Feelgood –</strong> <i>“The news is gloomy, I only read happy stories or ones that directly affect me”</i></li>
  <li><strong>Social Connectors –</strong> <i>“I feel like I ought to know and share the news as a responsible citizen”</i></li>
</ol>

The challenge was to attract 16-34-year-olds, young females and minority ethnic users, while keeping our core user base aged over 35s happy.

Establishing the right balance between hard and soft news was essential to attract a broader audience into the BBC News site.

<h2>My Role</h2>

<strong>Product Team</strong><br />
I work closely with engineers and the Product Manager to help solve problems, scope potential new features and brainstorm ideas on how to implement them.

<strong>Editorial Team & Senior Stakeholders</strong><br />
I run workshops with Editorial and Senior Stakeholders to help define the content strategy for the homepage and to manage expectations.

I worked with Global News Limited (commercial arm of BBC News) to ensure that the homepage works with adverts and commercial content.

<strong>Design Team</strong><br />
I lead the discovery phase. This involved doing competitor research, sketching and shadowing homepage editors to understand the editorial workflow.

I've designed the Homepage entirely in HTML/CSS and some Javascript. This meant that I had a prototype that was always ready to be tested with users.

I work with the News World Service design team to ensure that the News homepage design works across multiple languages.

I work with the BBC Global Experience Language (GEL) design team to redefine the grid for wider screens, and to ensure consistency across our platform by using reusable components and improving existing design patterns.

<strong>Usability Research</strong><br />
I’ve gone out to perform usability research in London and Toronto  with the research team to gather feedback and validate design concepts.

<h2>Design Process</h2>

<h4>Talk to people. Observe. Get inspired.</h4>
<i>Talk to people, analyse data, gather requirements, observe, throw away an preconceived assumptions. Inspire new thinking by observing problems from different angles.</i>

During the discovery phase I start gathering requirements from stakeholders. It's also important to know who the stakeholders are. For an organisation the size of the BBC, the decision making process can be complex.

</figure>

I carry out audience and competitor analysis to gather data and insights into user behaviours. This ultimately will inform my design decisions

I shadow senior homepage editors and journalists to understand their workflow when curating stories to be featured on the homepage.

I talk to developers. I question everything and challenge any preconceived assumption.

<h4>Make sense of the findings</h4>
At this stage, I start making sense of the unstructured data from my research and findings. Problems are then converted to HMW questions (“How Might We...”):

<ul>
  <li>How Might We achieve optimal content density?</li>
  <li>How Might We create better content groupings </li>
  <li>How Might We entice people to scroll further down the page</li>
  <li>How Might We create a design that caters for underserved audiences?</li>
  <li>How Might We offer flexibility for Editorial to curate the news depending on the news agenda?</li>
</ul>


<h4>Don't get attached to ideas</h4>
I start sketching on paper and presenting ideas during the Team Crits meetings. I don't get attached to any idea. This is a collective process of throwing away ideas. By eliminating ideas only the good ones persist or at least the ones that are technically feasible.

We all started to have a clear picture on what we wanted to achieve.

We wanted to introduce a "Slice design". Slices run horizontally across the full width of the screen. They are easy to reorder, the content hierarchy is consistent across all the breakpoints. It also provides more flexibility for editorial to reorder content depending on the news agenda.

This approach required defining new content groupings. So, we setup a Editorial and Product workshop.

<h4>Setup a workshop with stakeholders</h4>
<!-- <figure class="section__title">

The goal for the Editorial and Product workshop was to prune, group, reorder content, and to move away from traditional sectioned content.

Three groups of mixed people representing Product and Editorial were created. I moderate a group of very challenging stakeholders.

The outcome was positive. It gave me all the information I needed to start designing / prototyping.

<h2>Designing in the Browser</h2>
My goal for this project is to design the homepage entirely in HTML/CSS/JS. This was done to facilitate the communication with the engineering team and stakeholders.

In my experience designing a responsive site as static designs in Sketch, Illustrator or Photoshop makes it harder to have a discussion with software engineers.   

Designing in HTML/CSS was a way to solve frontend problems before they happen during the build.

I work closely with software engineers to solve design challenges and improve accessibility

<strong>User Testing</strong><br />
 I went on to test the homepage using the prototype that I built in UK and in Canada. Designing in browser empowered me to frequently carry-out guerrilla testing sessions.

<h2>Outcome</h2>
The front page is now better at getting people to content: bounce rate (the proportion of visits that result in a user leaving the BBC News site without visiting any other News page) is down 2% and overall 26% of all article views in News are now driven by the front page, up from 22% on the old page.

The page also does a much better job of getting people to video content, with 32% of video page views coming from the front page versus 10% previously. It is also making people come back more often: front page users now come back on average 9% more often during a week than they did with the old page design.
